What is FastLearn
###################

A PHP based quizzing system which uses CodeIgniter on the back-end. It also has an integrated python script which uses Natural Language Processing to generate questions automatically from a given paragraph of text.

[Demo](http://fastlearn.esthe.tech/)

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************

Please see the `installation section <https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html>`_
of the CodeIgniter User Guide.
